    "Project Overview": "This project aims to create a home automation system that allows users to control devices remotely using a Flutter application. The NodeMCU will act as the microcontroller interfacing with various home appliances and communicating with the Flutter app.",
    "Requirements": {
        "Hardware": [
            "NodeMCU (ESP8266)",
            "Breadboard",
            "Jumper wires",
            "Relay module (to control high-voltage devices)",
            "Home appliances (like a lamp or fan)",
            "Power supply"
        ],
        "Software": [
            "Arduino IDE (for programming NodeMCU)",
            "Flutter SDK (for developing the mobile application)",
            "Firebase account (for real-time database)"
        ]
    },
    "Setup Instructions": {
        "NodeMCU Setup": [
            "Install Arduino IDE.",
            "Install ESP8266 Board in Arduino IDE.",
            "Connect NodeMCU to your computer using a USB cable."
        ],
        "Flutter App Setup": [
            "Install Flutter.",
            "Create a New Flutter Project.",
            "Add Dependencies in pubspec.yaml."
        ]
    },
    "Connecting Hardware": [
        "Wiring the Relay module to the NodeMCU:",
        "- Relay IN1 to D1 (GPIO5)",
        "- VCC to 3.3V",
        "- GND to GND",
        "Connect the appliance to the relay.",
        "Power the NodeMCU."
    ],
    "Testing the System": [
        "Run the Flutter app.",
        "Toggle the switch in the app to turn the connected device ON/OFF."
    ],
    "Troubleshooting": {
        "NodeMCU not connecting to Wi-Fi": [
            "Check Wi-Fi credentials.",
            "Ensure the router is working."
        ],
        "Flutter app not communicating with Firebase": [
            "Verify Firebase configuration and internet connection."
        ],
        "Device not responding": [
            "Check the relay connections and power supply."
        ]
    },
    "Conclusion": "Congratulations! You have successfully set up a home automation system using Flutter and NodeMCU. You can expand this project by adding more devices and implementing additional features like scheduling and monitoring."
